# UMTSM C Examples

Examples of Generating State Machines in C

This repository contains example projects that demonstrate how to generate and work with state machines using **UMTSM**, a proprietary, UML-based state machine definition tool. UMTSM allows developers to define state machines using its own modeling language and generate source code in multiple programming languages and frameworks.

These examples focus on **C language** and illustrate how to model, generate, and execute state machines with UMTSM.

## Project Structure

Each example resides in its own directory. Some examples are further divided into multiple "cases", each demonstrating different states or behaviors, organized in subdirectories.

A typical example includes two main directories:

- **`src/`**  
  Contains manually written code. In particular:
  - `src/main/` includes the C `main()` function, which initializes and runs the state machines.
  - Other subdirectories contain:
    - `.umt` files, which define the state machines.
    - Function files that implement behaviors required by the state machines — these must be implemented by the developer.

- **`generated/`**  
  Contains code automatically generated by **UMTSM** and the **CGen** code generator for the C language.
  - `generated/src/` includes generated C code for the state machines.
  - `generated/test/` contains auto-generated C++ test files using **gTest/gMock**, also produced by CGen.

Build configuration files (`CMakeLists.txt`) required to compile the examples are generated by UMTSM and CGen. Dependencies between state machines and external libraries are handled via helper scripts such as `CmakeExtras.cmake`.

## Included Examples

The repository includes the following sample applications:

- **01-paroot** — Solves parabolic equations  
  - `case-0`: A classical approach before introducing state machines  
  - `case-1`, `case-2`: Variants using state machine modeling

- **02-numberguess** — A number guessing game (between 1 and 99)  
  - `case-1`, `case-2`, `case-3`: Different implementations and state modeling approaches

- **03-keypress** — Tracks and sorts pressed keys

- **04-calculator** — A simple four-function calculator

- **05-crossroad** — Manages a four-lane junction and pedestrian crossings in both controlled and uncontrolled modes

- **06-timewatch** — A stopwatch application that tracks elapsed time
